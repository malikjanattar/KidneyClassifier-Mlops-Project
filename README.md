# Kidney Tumor Classification Project

The Kidney Tumor Classification project represents a significant stride in leveraging cutting-edge machine learning methodologies to address healthcare challenges. By meticulously organizing and importing diverse datasets, we established a foundation for comprehensive model training. Fine-tuning the pre-trained Keras VGG-16 model for two output classes using softmax activation became a pivotal step in tailoring the model for kidney tumor classification. The implementation of end-to-end pipelines, covering data preparation, model training, and evaluation, ensures a systematic and efficient workflow. Integration with MLflow enhances our ability to track and evaluate the model's performance throughout its lifecycle.





## Overview :

Our Kidney Tumor Classification project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to create a robust system for accurately identifying kidney tumors. Here's a concise overview of our journey:

1. Data Ingestion:
We started by efficiently organizing and importing diverse datasets. This step is crucial to ensure the model is trained on a comprehensive set of data, contributing to its overall accuracy.

2. Prepare Base Model:
The pre-trained Keras VGG-16 model became our foundation. We fine-tuned it specifically for kidney tumor classification, adjusting the last layer for two output classes with softmax activation.

3. End-to-End Pipelines:
Our project features end-to-end pipelines, covering data preparation, model training, and model evaluation. These pipelines ensure a systematic and efficient workflow, streamlining the entire process.

4. MLflow Integration:
To maintain meticulous tracking and evaluation of our model throughout its lifecycle, we integrated MLflow. This tool proves invaluable in understanding the model's performance and making informed decisions during development.

5. User App Development:
Crafting a user-friendly interface for seamless image uploads and real-time predictions.

6. Deployment on Cloud:
Our final step involves deploying the model on the cloud using Docker and DVC. This ensures accessibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance for the deployed model.
